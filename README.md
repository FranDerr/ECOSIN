# ECOSIN
Ecosin is an innovative system created to efficiently and sustainably address the problems related to pollution and urban waste management. The system is designed to be distributed by municipalities directly as public bodies, with the aim of making the disposal and recycling process of domestic and urban waste easier, more automated and sustainable. The municipality manages the installation and monitoring of Ecosin in the various city points, keeping track of which areas have the device and facilitating the logistics for dust collection. Through a centralized system, the municipality can monitor the filling levels and organize collection shifts according to needs, improving the efficiency of waste management and reducing emissions associated with transport. Ecosin is a project designed for modern and sustainable cities. Thanks to its technology, it allows for improved waste management and reduced environmental impact, representing an innovative alternative for communities committed to building a cleaner and more efficient future.
